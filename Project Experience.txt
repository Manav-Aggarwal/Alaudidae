Hello Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi,

I have finished working on the assignment you gave me in your last email.
Took me around 7 hours to get everything done.

I must say it was one of the most fun and challenging things I've worked on, and 
it has given me confidence that I can actually work on real world stuff now. 

I'd love to work on more assignments like these while working with Alaudidae.
Please find instructions on how to running the script in the README.MD file in the
github repository located here: https://github.com/Manav-Aggarwal/Alaudidae/

I have put the KML of the drone path from the video in the repository as well and the 
script I wrote has function that can generate KML files for any videos, if you need it.

PS. I spent some time thinking about what we could do with this data. We could generate a 
360 degree image of the terrain using panaroma and stich these images together since they 
must be overlapping by a certain extent. It could be useful to convert 3D terrain maps from these images as well.
This will help our clients better visualize the area.

Warm regards,
Manav Aggarwal
